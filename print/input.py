    Most countries use the metric system for recipe measurement, 
    but American bakers use a different system. For example, they use 
    fluid ounces to measure liquids instead of milliliters (ml).
    
    So you need to convert recipe units to your local measuring system!
    
    For example, 8 fluid ounces of milk is 8 * 29.5735 ml.
    And 100ml of water is {100 / 29.5735} fluid ounces.ssssssss
